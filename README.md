# Wordpress Portfolio Theme
Early beta version of my personal Wordpress portfolio theme as seen in action [here](http://erling.tokheim.no).

I'm sure this will be an awesome free theme one day, but until then, I wouldn't recommend you using it - it's far from finished and the code is written in a very "trail and error-y" way, aka very messy :)

However, feel free to fork this repository and modify the code however you want. Contact me for more information.

# Dependencies
This theme requires the [Dynamic Featured Image](http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=plugin-information&plugin=dynamic-featured-image&TB_iframe=true&width=600&height=550) plugin. That plugin let's you add multiple images to a page, which is the images the slideshow uses.
